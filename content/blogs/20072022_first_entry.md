I came across Hugo in a fortunate way in April this year. It was thanks to
the course I took with Innovaccion Virtual that I got to hear about Hugo. The 
instructor, [Carlo Gilmar](https://github.com/carlogilmar), showed us how to 
create a small static website for blogging and publishing how our learning 
path has been in the course.

After that, my attention diverged to understanding how Hugo worked and I started
to do things that I wasn't supposed to do, such as this profile page on GitHub.
I saw that I could do many simple things with Hugo and I was absorbed by it
a couple of weeks until I got comfortable with the "end product" of this site 
:smirk:

Today I thought about using the Blog feature and the whole reason why Carlo 
taught us about Hugo ... to write down our learning progress in a blog. My idea 
of this blog is however to post about any interesting and appealing stuff I 
come across, let that be geeky stuff or non-geeky topic.

Let this blog be inaugurated today.

Some posts ago I published that I was embarking myself into learning Java. 
Today I realized that it's been a month now! :open_mouth: My previous post was
a bit opinionated on why I had never learned Java. It makes sense to write an
update on this mission.

## First month thoughts

As per my previous post, I decided to follow the 
[Java Programming MOOC](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/), and I have done it
thoroughly this month. The content is well laid-out and with many exercises for 
making me feel comfortable with the language syntax. I have covered the first 5 
parts (out of 7). I have to give it to the course organizers, I have changed my
mind about Java. I don't love it, but I see why Java is the staple language for 
teaching object-oriented programming, it's quite didactic. 

I haven't written a line of C# code since 2020, and Java made me remember those
times. The fact that C# and Java have similar syntaxes has been an advantage for 
going through the course slightly faster. To be fair, I learned C# on the go, 
with work being my main driving force for making the program compile :zany_face: 

I am considering on doing the second Java course from the University of Helsinki,
why not? The material keeps building on complexity and has now hooked me to code 
a bit more on Java every day. 

The whole reason why I decided to learn Java was because of a job requirement, 
and I am glad I started learning before starting my full-time job. The 
proprietary solution that is used at work is heavily _inspired_ in Java. It has
a plugin for Eclipse. More Java stuff for me LOL.

## Lessons learned

So far so good, and I have learned stuff on the way (on top of Java syntax). 
Here are the main ones:

- I installed OpenJDK 11 in the beginning, but I did not like that VSCode kept 
complaining about "not finding Maven", so I ended up removing OpenJDK 11 and
installed Oracle Java instead. VSCode does not complain anymore. I still don't 
know exactly what Maven is, but I'll find out soon :grinning:
- The official Java documentation is not that friendly, but hey this is my 
personal opinion. Perhaps I am biased after coding in C# and Python (their
docs are excellent!). Java docs is good though.
- Rarely the Java MOOC material is not that detailed and it does not explain
some details. For instance, the exercises where you have to use the `Paths.get()`
method. I spent a lot of time on it, thinking that I was doing something wrong.
However, it was all a misunderstanding about what the method does.
- I installed Java on both Linux and Windows. Both times I had to uninstall
and then install a different version. The winner was Linux. No need to do
esoteric stuff on environment variables. Windows is messy, but we knew that 
already :zany_face:
- I didn't realize how much I missed writing proper code. After spending almost
2 years writing Python (and seldom R), I almost forgot about access modifiers,
reference variables and OOP concepts. C# and Java are my favourite languages
for OOP. Sorry not sorry Python.
- The experience of writing Java in VSCode is completely different to writing 
code in Eclipse. True, Eclipse is an IDE (i.e. heavy, bulky, _bloating_) but it
does have everything for creating a Java project from scratch. In fact, Java
MOOC recommended to use NetBeans but as usual, I'm a bad a student...

That's it for now, month 2 and counting.

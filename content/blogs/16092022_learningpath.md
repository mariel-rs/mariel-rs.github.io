Today I started the second Java Programming course that the University of
Helsinki offers as MOOC. I had such a good impression from the first part of the
course that I decided to go for the next one. However, this made me think of the
next steps in my learning path.

## Learning topics

Despite having been working in technology for more than 7 years now, I started 
on my coding path in early 2019. I was more familiar with IT stuff such as 
protocols, firewalls, networks and general troubleshooting. In these 3+ years I 
realized that coding is an ongoing learning process, if the aim is to stay up
to date with latest trends and technologies available. 

Now that I have landed on a much more technical role than before, and of course
more challenging, I have to be more organized on my spare time and what I 
dedicate energy to. I came up with the following list of items to work on for 
the next 6 - 12 months.

### Java

After finishing the first MOOC, I decided to take a short break of a week before
starting the second part of the course. The second part is the last MOOC offered
by UH and to be straightforward, I do not want these skills to go to oblivion 
after completing it. Gladly, my current job requires me to always
_think Java_ and keeps me focused on it.

I saw that the second course covers much more advanced topics, yet the course
aim is to introduce concepts. I finally bought a book for covering topics in a 
deeper way and to start with typical frameworks used in real solutions.

### Web development

This year I also took a short course on web development offered by LaunchX, and 
sadly (or happily?) I only got interested only by one part of the course: 
Backend using NodeJS. To make the story short, I found that part to be the most
comprehensive and hands-on than the rest of the course. This left me with
several deficiencies on the front-end side that I want to fix as I still want to 
develop my small site to test experimental optimization applications for 
out-of-the-blue problems.

This being said, I have decided to take another course on web development and go 
further than easy tutorials. I had two runner-ups: The Odin Project(TOP) and 
freeCodeCamp. After looking thoroughly at the contents, exercises and reviews, 
the winner is TOP.

### Linux

This is an ongoing learning "mission". I have already started it now that I have 
my development environment running on Ubuntu MATE. I am developing most of my 
time on my Linux machine rather than on my Windows machine :nerd_face: Yet, 
there are things I want to learn and improve:

1. Bash scripting
2. Terminal
3. Learning more about Vim keyboard shortcuts

For the first two items, I am still deciding whether it makes sense to follow
a book or to find a course. For Vim, I found a few Youtube videos. However, I
am not a fan of videos for programming, unless it's for a specific thing and not
a hand-holding session. I started playing with Vim this year and it's definitely
something that is worth learning.

### Docker

Oh yes, containers. This is such a needed one. I played with containers briefly
on the [CReDo](https://digitaltwinhub.co.uk/credo/) project. We used Podman there
and it was quite easy to use, but I want to really understand how to build a
container from scratch (not just to take someone else's script). Since this is
a topic that I will touch base on in a while, I haven't really looked for 
appropriate resources to learn Docker. As soon as a I progress on my learning
path, I'll get onto it.

### Data Structures and Algorithms

This is definitely a so neglected and pending assignment since forever. I did 
a bit of algorithms on my MSc, yet it was almost nothing as the MSc was too
hectic and fast. For this one, I have found a Udemy course and I think a 
textbook will work fine for me. Still deciding which one though...

### Python

Python and I met in 2020. We had a great ride together, from an MSc to a 
government project. I still think that it's a great language for beginners and 
even for prototyping, but not for large programs. Funny enough, the more I learn 
from other languages, the more [_saudade_ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudade)
of Python I feel :zany_face: Nonetheless, whenever I make the time to go back to 
Python, I want to dedicate my time on the following items:

1. Pytest
2. OOP, for real
3. Decorators
4. Queues, stacks

## Final thoughts
I could keep writing more about things I want to learn. Yet, as I learned when
I started my first job in technology, this is an endurance race and it is not 
meant to be run. Better to take continuous baby steps and progress on this
ongoing path. For sure, I will have to work on organizing my time in a smart 
way, but that's a topic for another day.

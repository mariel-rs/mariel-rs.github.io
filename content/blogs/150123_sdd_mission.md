Last week my beloved Ubuntu MATE development environment exhibited many signals 
of decay. I found out the laptop's hard drive is faulting - no wonder, it's an
old laptop with a _mechanical_ hard drive. This post briefly summarizes my
thoughts on how I am venturing to install an SSD on my own for the first time.

Let's face it, we are not jack of all trades. At least, I am not. While I am 
confident on my software skills, I am not that knowledgeable on the hardware
side of computers. However, I have what many people call "hands of fire" and I
can easily break up setups while I learn. This is usually not a problem with
software as there's always the option to reinstall, uninstall, push previous 
versions or as a last resource, format a hard drive. But for hardware, this gets 
trickier.

The name of this blog post recalls a conversation I had where problems should be
called opportunities instead. However, I'm the kind of person who thinks we 
have both of them - problems and opportunities. My problem is that the laptop is
about to die sooner or later because the hard drive is giving up. There are at 
least 10 damaged sectors. I haven't been able to continue with my Java exercises
because of this. This is the laptop I prepared last summer that has served me 
very well over these months. Sadly, it's getting slower and slower :worried:

Nonetheless, I have a great opportunity to upgrade my old ASUS laptop with a 
new hard drive. Why not an SSD?. I quoted how much it would cost me to do this 
with the local technicians, and it turned out that they only sell Kingston A400 
SSD's, which is not a bad SSD, yet not what I am looking for in terms of 
performance. On top of paying for the SSD, I would also need to pay for the 
setup, roughly 50% of the cost of the drive.

So I decided to put that investment in a better SSD, a [Crucial MX500*](https://www.crucial.com/products/ssd/crucial-mx500-ssd)
and install it myself. I found a good deal online and made the purchase. I am 
writing these lines as I am waiting for the parcel to arrive today. But this 
leads me to my intrinsic learning style. A problem? An opportunity to learn?

* n.b. I was highly tempted to get a Samsung 870 EVO, yet since this is a laptop 
from 2013, I thought the EVO was too much. I also don't want to damage such an
expensive SSD :zany_face:

Now that I've run into this last difficulty, I think what comes next is a
_challenge_ wrapped in a mission - that is, if I want my laptop to be 
functional :zany_face: I have gone through several videos showing how to 
properly change a hard drive, so it's only matter of time for the parcel to
arrive and doing my first laptop SSD setup myself for seeing whether this mission
is successful... or not.

The laptop also has one damaged speaker that I could replace, yet I am waiting
for the SSD mission outcome. I do prefer this wording though, **mission**. It
encapsulates the problem, the adrenaline, the challenges and difficulties, and 
the final reward.

If I am successful, I only need to ensure that my TestMyCode setup works well
with my cloned Java exercises repo (Java programming II course). That's a mission 
for another day.

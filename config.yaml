    title: "About Me"

    content: |-
      I am an engineer with an innate taste for programming languages, 
      technology and applied mathematics. I carry 7+ years of combined 
      experience in technical consulting and software development in the United 
      Kingdom and Mexico. I have a strong interest in making Analytics more 
      accessible to organizations with operations challenges and provide value 
      to their business. 
      
      I am currently working as an Analytics consultant in Mexico. My current 
      project analyzes the sense of belonging of University students in new 
      cohorts and  the challenges of online learning, via sentiment analysis and 
      text mining techniques on satisfaction surveys. The results of this project 
      will be used to help the University staff to foster a more suitable 
      environment for students and keep student attrition rates low.

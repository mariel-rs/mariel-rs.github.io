    content: |-
      I am an engineer with an innate taste for programming languages, technology 
      and applied mathematics. I carry 7+ years of combined experience in technical 
      consulting and software development in the United Kingdom and Mexico.
      My background is in Chemical engineering and Operational research
      (the discipline of decision-making using advanced analytical methods).
      I have a strong interest in making Analytics more accessible to organizations
      with operations challenges and provide value to their business. 
      
      I am currently working as an Analytics consultant in Mexico. My current project 
      analyzes the sense of belonging of University students in new cohorts and 
      the challenges of online learning, via sentiment analysis and text mining 
      techniques on satisfaction surveys. This project will be used to help the 
      University staff to foster a more suitable environment for students and 
      keep student attrition rates low.

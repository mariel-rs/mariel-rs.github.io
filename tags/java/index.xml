I had to push a temporary pause to my Java course, but I&amp;rsquo;m back. In this post,
I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about the famous streams that I have never heard about, yet I have
worked similar operations in other programming languages.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Interfaces</title><link>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/22102022_interfaces/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/22102022_interfaces/</guid><description>&lt;p>After some weeks of neglecting my self-study Java time, I finally got the time
to get back on track this week and I reached the &lt;strong>Interfaces&lt;/strong> topic. I learned
this topic when I studied C# some years ago, but it&amp;rsquo;s not quite like that time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Java Programming I MOOC</title><link>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/12092022_javamooc_i/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/12092022_javamooc_i/</guid><description>&lt;p>This weekend I finished the Java Programming I course offered as a MOOC by the
University of Helsinki. Here are my thoughts after &lt;em>circa&lt;/em> 6 weeks of Java. This
is going to be a lengthy post, so if you feel like reading, let&amp;rsquo;s crack on.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Java - One month later</title><link>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/27082022_firstmonthjava/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/27082022_firstmonthjava/</guid><description>&lt;p>Some posts ago I published that I was embarking myself into learning Java.
Today I realized that it&amp;rsquo;s been a month now! :open_mouth: My previous post was
a bit opinionated on why I had never learned Java. It makes sense to write an
update on this mission.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Java strikes back!</title><link>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/27072022_java/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/27072022_java/</guid><description>&lt;p>Java was supposed to be the first programming language I would learn. I remember
it was around 2013 when I had the idea about learning how to program. As a good
newbie, I downloaded the official Java development kit (JDK) and then&amp;hellip; I never
really got around it, until now &lt;strong>2022&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

Dvorak. When I learned typewriting and touch typing in school, QWERTY was the
only one in use. This month I have started learning Dvorak and I&amp;rsquo;m looking
forward to destroy/enhance my muscle memory.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Problems, opportunities and a mission with a dying laptop hard drive</title><link>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/150123_sdd_mission/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/150123_sdd_mission/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last week my beloved Ubuntu MATE development environment exhibited many signals
of decay. I found out the laptop&amp;rsquo;s hard drive is faulting - no wonder, it&amp;rsquo;s an
old laptop with a &lt;em>mechanical&lt;/em> hard drive. This post briefly summarizes my
thoughts on how I am venturing to install an SSD on my own for the first time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The scientific computing world of Julia</title><link>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/29122022_julia/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/29122022_julia/</guid><description>&lt;p>This seems to be a festive season and I decided to give my fresh Linux OS a new
programming language: Julia. I heard of it during my MSc, but I never took
the time to dig in deeper in the language. Here are my first impressions of
Julia.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hello from Pop!_OS</title><link>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/27122022_popos/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/27122022_popos/</guid><description>&lt;p>On Christmas Eve I decided try a new chicken recipe and Pop!_OS 22.04, an
Ubuntu-based Linux distribution. The chicken was tasty and juicy that day and
got even better the next day. However, Pop!_OS turned out even better than the
dinner. Here are my thoughts and impressions of this distribution.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Flowing like a stream</title><link>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/19112022_java_streams/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/19112022_java_streams/</guid><description>&lt;p>This has been a hectic period and as a consequence, I have neglected this blog.
I had to push a temporary pause to my Java course, but I&amp;rsquo;m back. In this post,
I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about the famous streams that I have never heard about, yet I have
worked similar operations in other programming languages.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Interfaces</title><link>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/22102022_interfaces/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/22102022_interfaces/</guid><description>&lt;p>After some weeks of neglecting my self-study Java time, I finally got the time
to get back on track this week and I reached the &lt;strong>Interfaces&lt;/strong> topic. I learned
this topic when I studied C# some years ago, but it&amp;rsquo;s not quite like that time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kernel panic with VirtualBox and CentOS</title><link>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/24092022_kernelpanic/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/24092022_kernelpanic/</guid><description>&lt;p>This week I was given a task that required me to use a CentOS virtual machine
image. Typically, I use VirtualBox and it was also recommended using this
hypervisor. Importing the image should have been a straightforward process, yet
it was more educational.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Learning path: first draft</title><link>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/16092022_learningpath/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/16092022_learningpath/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today I started the second Java Programming course that the University of
Helsinki offers as MOOC. I had such a good impression from the first part of the
course that I decided to go for the next one. However, this made me think of the
next steps in my learning path.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Java Programming I MOOC</title><link>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/12092022_javamooc_i/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/12092022_javamooc_i/</guid><description>&lt;p>This weekend I finished the Java Programming I course offered as a MOOC by the
University of Helsinki. Here are my thoughts after &lt;em>circa&lt;/em> 6 weeks of Java. This
is going to be a lengthy post, so if you feel like reading, let&amp;rsquo;s crack on.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Java - One month later</title><link>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/27082022_firstmonthjava/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/27082022_firstmonthjava/</guid><description>&lt;p>Some posts ago I published that I was embarking myself into learning Java.
Today I realized that it&amp;rsquo;s been a month now! :open_mouth: My previous post was
a bit opinionated on why I had never learned Java. It makes sense to write an
update on this mission.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hello Jammy Jellyfish</title><link>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/21082022_jellyfish/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/21082022_jellyfish/</guid><description>&lt;p>This was the weekend for the so much awaited upgrade to Ubuntu 22.04.1. I
installed Ubuntu 20.04 because it was the LTS version available and I didn&amp;rsquo;t
want to be messing around upgrades. After seeing first-hand how Windows upgrades
could be nasty, horrible or fatal, I wanted to avoid a bittersweet experience
with Ubuntu.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hugo pages and themes as submodules</title><link>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/07082022_hugo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/07082022_hugo/</guid><description>&lt;p>This GitHub page uses Hugo as site generator. Specifically, it uses the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/gurusabarish/hugo-profile">hugo-profile&lt;/a> theme. When I
created this page, I did it from my Windows dev environment and it was all fine.
But after cloning the page repository on my Linux environment, I never thought
I would learn more about Git :smile:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My dev environment</title><link>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/29072022_dev_env/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/29072022_dev_env/</guid><description>&lt;p>When I started my programming journey, I saw that each course / textbook / online
class I browsed, they would have a suggested set of tools and stack.
Even during my masters, the Python programming course organiser had a set of
tools, which btw, were not my &amp;ldquo;cup of tea&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Java strikes back!</title><link>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/27072022_java/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/27072022_java/</guid><description>&lt;p>Java was supposed to be the first programming language I would learn. I remember
it was around 2013 when I had the idea about learning how to program. As a good
newbie, I downloaded the official Java development kit (JDK) and then&amp;hellip; I never
really got around it, until now &lt;strong>2022&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The path to Linux via Ubuntu MATE</title><link>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/26072022_linux/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/26072022_linux/</guid><description>&lt;p>So this is me updating this blog from my Linux machine. It&amp;rsquo;s an old laptop from
around 2014 that I bought for finishing my bachelor&amp;rsquo;s thesis. So far so good,
yet not quite the same as doing this from Windows. It&amp;rsquo;s been a fun adventure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>First blog entry</title><link>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/20072022_first_entry/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jul 2022 22:53:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/20072022_first_entry/</guid><description>&lt;p>I came across Hugo in a fortunate way in April this year. It was thanks to
the course I took with Innovaccion Virtual that I got to hear about Hugo. The
instructor, &lt;a href="https://github.com/carlogilmar">Carlo Gilmar&lt;/a>, showed us how to
create a small static website for blogging and publishing how our learning
path has been in the course.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

image. Typically, I use VirtualBox and it was also recommended using this
hypervisor. Importing the image should have been a straightforward process, yet
it was more educational.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Learning path: first draft</title><link>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/16092022_learningpath/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/16092022_learningpath/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today I started the second Java Programming course that the University of
Helsinki offers as MOOC. I had such a good impression from the first part of the
course that I decided to go for the next one. However, this made me think of the
next steps in my learning path.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Java Programming I MOOC</title><link>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/12092022_javamooc_i/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/12092022_javamooc_i/</guid><description>&lt;p>This weekend I finished the Java Programming I course offered as a MOOC by the
University of Helsinki. Here are my thoughts after &lt;em>circa&lt;/em> 6 weeks of Java. This
is going to be a lengthy post, so if you feel like reading, let&amp;rsquo;s crack on.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Java - One month later</title><link>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/27082022_firstmonthjava/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/27082022_firstmonthjava/</guid><description>&lt;p>Some posts ago I published that I was embarking myself into learning Java.
Today I realized that it&amp;rsquo;s been a month now! :open_mouth: My previous post was
a bit opinionated on why I had never learned Java. It makes sense to write an
update on this mission.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hello Jammy Jellyfish</title><link>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/21082022_jellyfish/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/21082022_jellyfish/</guid><description>&lt;p>This was the weekend for the so much awaited upgrade to Ubuntu 22.04.1. I
installed Ubuntu 20.04 because it was the LTS version available and I didn&amp;rsquo;t
want to be messing around upgrades. After seeing first-hand how Windows upgrades
could be nasty, horrible or fatal, I wanted to avoid a bittersweet experience
with Ubuntu.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hugo pages and themes as submodules</title><link>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/07082022_hugo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/07082022_hugo/</guid><description>&lt;p>This GitHub page uses Hugo as site generator. Specifically, it uses the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/gurusabarish/hugo-profile">hugo-profile&lt;/a> theme. When I
created this page, I did it from my Windows dev environment and it was all fine.
But after cloning the page repository on my Linux environment, I never thought
I would learn more about Git :smile:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My dev environment</title><link>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/29072022_dev_env/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/29072022_dev_env/</guid><description>&lt;p>When I started my programming journey, I saw that each course / textbook / online
class I browsed, they would have a suggested set of tools and stack.
Even during my masters, the Python programming course organiser had a set of
tools, which btw, were not my &amp;ldquo;cup of tea&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Java strikes back!</title><link>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/27072022_java/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/27072022_java/</guid><description>&lt;p>Java was supposed to be the first programming language I would learn. I remember
it was around 2013 when I had the idea about learning how to program. As a good
newbie, I downloaded the official Java development kit (JDK) and then&amp;hellip; I never
really got around it, until now &lt;strong>2022&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The path to Linux via Ubuntu MATE</title><link>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/26072022_linux/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/26072022_linux/</guid><description>&lt;p>So this is me updating this blog from my Linux machine. It&amp;rsquo;s an old laptop from
around 2014 that I bought for finishing my bachelor&amp;rsquo;s thesis. So far so good,
yet not quite the same as doing this from Windows. It&amp;rsquo;s been a fun adventure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>First blog entry</title><link>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/20072022_first_entry/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jul 2022 22:53:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://mariel-rs.github.io/blogs/20072022_first_entry/</guid><description>&lt;p>I came across Hugo in a fortunate way in April this year. It was thanks to
the course I took with Innovaccion Virtual that I got to hear about Hugo. The
instructor, &lt;a href="https://github.com/carlogilmar">Carlo Gilmar&lt;/a>, showed us how to
create a small static website for blogging and publishing how our learning
path has been in the course.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Markdown Syntax</title><link>https://mariel-rs.github.io/sample/markdown-syntax/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Apr 2021 23:29:21 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://mariel-rs.github.io/sample/markdown-syntax/</guid><description>&lt;p>This article offers a sample of basic Markdown syntax that can be used in Hugo content files, also it shows whether basic HTML elements are decorated with CSS in a Hugo theme.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Emoji Support</title><link>https://mariel-rs.github.io/sample/emoji-support/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Apr 2021 22:53:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://mariel-rs.github.io/sample/emoji-support/</guid><description>Emoji can be enabled in a Hugo project in a number of ways. :zap:
Emoji Support The emojify function can be called directly in templates or Inline Shortcodes.
To enable emoji globally, set enableEmoji to true in your siteâ€™s configuration and then you can type emoji shorthand codes directly in content files; e.g.
The Emoji cheat sheet is a useful reference for emoji shorthand codes.
N.B. The above steps enable Unicode Standard emoji characters and sequences in Hugo, however the rendering of these glyphs depends on the browser and the platform.</description></item><item><title>Placeholder Text</title><link>https://mariel-rs.github.io/sample/placeholder-text/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Apr 2021 22:41:10 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://mariel-rs.github.io/sample/placeholder-text/</guid><description>Lorem est tota propiore conpellat pectoribus de pectora summo.
